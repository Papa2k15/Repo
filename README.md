# LifeScore

## By Gregory L. Daniels 

LifeScore is a gamified chore application with purpose to gamify everyday life chores/tasks. I was inspired to create LifeScore from my interest in video games. I thought about how much I like the idea of being rewarded for completing tasks and wanted it to be socially involved. The program is currently being written in Java with MySQL and is still in a primitive state. There is a lot that I plan on implementing, but I am taking it one day at a time. Send me a message if you would like to help me with the production of this application. I really feel like this program could be rewarding if done correctly.
